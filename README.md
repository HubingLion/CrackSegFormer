This repository is produced to share material relevant to the Journal paper Automatic crack detection on concrete and asphalt surfaces using semantic segmentation network with hierarchical Transformer published in **Engineering structures**.

The train.py script in the tools directory is utilzed for training crack detection models, and the training outcomes can be found in the logs directory.
Due to time constraints, the code and instructions will be gradually refined.
